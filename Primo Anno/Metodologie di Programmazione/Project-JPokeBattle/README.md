## Getting Started

Welcome to the JPokeBattle Project!

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `Battle`
    - `Generic`
    - `Shared`
    - `Pok√®mon`
    - `Game`
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

To run the App you must go into the  `Src`  folder and run  `JPokeBattle.java`
